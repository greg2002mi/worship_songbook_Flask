# General

Web application is for Church worship teams. its main purpose to simplify their work, store songs with chords, and have easy access for every member during rehearsals or services.
Can also work as songbook, a tool to transpose any song.

Developed on Flask API. later encountered several clashes of some modules within one library, thus moved to Django API. Further development is done in [worship_songbook_django](https://github.com/greg2002mi/worship_songbook_django)https://github.com/greg2002mi/worship_songbook_django
